# About 
This is my first SwiftUI project, created to practice the skills I acquired while studying SwiftUI courses. The app is designed for English learning and includes various topics, explanations, and exercises. The main idea was to generate lessons and exercises using the ChatGPT API.

I couldn't find suitable examples of applications to use. The applications provided by SwiftUI courses didn't follow any specific architecture. None of the approaches I used in my UIKit experience seemed suitable for SwiftUI. Therefore, I decided to create an app based on my understanding of how an app with multiple screens should be structured. I used the MVVM architecture with the Combine framework to write clear and readable code. Also I used Combine for network requests. Additionally, I implemented a Coordinator pattern based on the native SwiftUI NavigationStack.

## Usage
If you do not have an API key generated in the OpenAI Developer Console, you can use the app in hardcoded mode just to test the UI.
